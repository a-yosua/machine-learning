# Machine Learning

This repository contains exercises implementing machine learning algorithms by using MATLAB.

[Logistic regression](../master/logistic-regression.md)

[Regularized logistic regression](../master/regularized-logistic-regression.md)

The following exercises build a neural network model by using TensorFlow.

[Simple neural network model](../master//TensorFlow_Exercise_1.ipynb)

[Learning different items in images](../master/TensorFlow_Exercise_2.ipynb)

From Django to call Amazon REST API to invoke Lambda function to predict cancer using the model endpoint deployed by SageMaker (will be available soon).

From Django to call Django REST API to return the prediction of type of flower from a pre-trained model with Scikit Learn (will be available soon).
